# just playing

## to (maybe) do

- [x] change color picker for "gorro" to only the allowed ones by the factory.
- [x] set colors to url as search params (and get them on page load) so each design is shareable just by sharing the url.
- [x] make the *share* button work.
- [x] improve/change the color pickers to not show keyboard
- [x] fix one color gets added to url on page init
